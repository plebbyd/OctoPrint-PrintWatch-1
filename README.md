# OctoPrint-PrintWatch
A plugin for the client-side operations of the PrintWatch API.

PrintWatch uses Artificial Intelligence to monitor your 3D prints for any defects that begin to form. The plugin takes actions set by the user once a failure is positively detected that include:
- Email Notification/SMS
- Pausing the print job
- Turning off the Extruder Heat
- Any other customized actions created by the user

PrintWatch saves time and material while also giving you peace of mind that your 3D print is printing properly.
